# Project Report for AI World Builder

## Program Created By:
Diego Mejia  
Nicolas Tran

## Overview
AI World Builder is a Java application that allows users to create, edit and manage AI-generated stories.  
The system uses a clean MVC architecture, persistent local storage, and a streaming AI service to generate chapter 
content in real time.

The project includes:
 - UI to help navigate through the project (Menu, Editor, Settings)
 - Persistence layer for stories, chapters, and storage
 - An AI service that streams tokens from a provider (personal API key required)
 - A full JUnit test suite

## Challenges & Fixes



## Design Pattern Justifications
### MVC (Model-View-Controller)
#### - Model: String 
#### - View: Swing UI pages
#### - Controller: MainController, EditorController

The app has clear separation between data, UI, and logic.
Controllers mediate between models and views, keeping the UI thin and testable.



## OOP Four Pillars
### 1. Encapsulation
- Persistence logic is hidden behind *Story Manager* and *AppSettingsManager*
- UI logic is encapsulated in *AIService* and *GeminiClient*
- UI logic is encapsulated in Swing pages

### 2. Inheritance
- Controllers implemented shared interfaces (*Editor Controller Interface*, *MainControllerInterface*)
### 3. Polymorphism
- Any class implementing *AIStreamLisenter* can receive streaming tokens.
- Any class implementing *EditorViewInterface* can be plugged into Editor Controller
- Strategy patern uses polymorphism to support multiple AI providerfs
### 4. Abstraction
- Controllers don't know how persistence work since they call manager classes
- Views don't know how AI works - they call controller methods
- AIService abstracts away the details of the Gemini API


## AI Usage

Copilot/ChatGPT was used for clarification, debugging, and architectural guidance. AI tools were also used as a learning
aid to understand the topics of this project more deeply. For example, understanding the api and service folder in terms
of its separation of concerns and how it transforms raw API output into data forms readable by the rest of the program.

Completions were used for small snippets, but all snippets were reviewed, modified, or rewritten in order to adapt to the rest of the program and we also fully understand the included code. No full solutions or full files were generated by AI.
