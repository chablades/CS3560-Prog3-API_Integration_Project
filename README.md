# CS3560-Prog3-API_Integration_Project

## How To Run

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/chablades/CS3560-Prog3-API_Integration_Project.git
cd CS3560-Prog3-API_Integration_Project
```

### 2. Create the resources folder
The project expects a configuration file at
```
src/main/resources/config.properties
```
If it does not exist, create the folder
```
src/
  main/
    java/
    resources/      <- create this folder
```

### 3. Create `config.properties`
Create the `config.properties` file inside the resources folder. Then add your **Spotify API** credentials in this format:
```properties
spotify.client.id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID_HERE
spotify.client.secret=YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET_HERE
```
Make sure **NOT** to include quotes when putting your credentials.
This file is gitignored, and will be protected

### 4. Run the project from root
Since this is a Maven project, run main using this command:
```bash
mvn clean compile exec:java
```


## AI Disclosure
Copilot/ChatGPT was used for clarification, debugging, and architectural guidance. AI tools were also used as a learning aid to understand the topics of this project more deeply. For example, understanding the `api` and `service` folder in terms of its separation of concerns and how it transforms raw API output into data forms readable by the rest of the program.

Completions were used for small snippets, but all snippets were reviewed, modified, or rewritten in order to adapt to the rest of the program and we also fully understand the included code. No full solutions or full files were generated by AI.
