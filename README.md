## AI Disclosure
Copilot/ChatGPT was used for clarification, debugging, and architectural guidance. AI tools were also used as a learning aid to understand the topics of this project more deeply. For example, understanding the `api` and `service` folder in terms of its separation of concerns and how it transforms raw API output into data forms readable by the rest of the program.

Completions were used for small snippets, but all snippets were reviewed, modified, or rewritten in order to adapt to the rest of the program and we also fully understand the included code. No full solutions or full files were generated by AI.
